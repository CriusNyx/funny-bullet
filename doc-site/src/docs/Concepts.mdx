# Concepts

The game explores relationship between the body, and horrors related to the body. 
We are pulling on experiences the horror of learning about how your body is 
gendered, or the horror of coming into adulthood with a womans body, or the 
horror of experiencing puberty more generally and using those to tell a story.

## Concept 1

There is a robot woman who is rebelling against her creator because she is 
unhappy with the way she was created, and the way her body works. Her body is 
partly robotic, and partly organic, and those things interact in ways that are 
gruesome and painful. For example, she might be able to transform her body to do
things like summon weapons, but in the process parts of her body are ripped 
apart or mutilated.

In the story she encounters opposition from other robot characters created by 
the creator. These characters are ignorant to the horrors of their own body, and 
those characters may be forced to confront that when the creator uses their 
bodies to transform them into gruesome weapons.
