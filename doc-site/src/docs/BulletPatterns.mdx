# Bullet Patterns

Bullet patterns are nodes which describe the order, position, and direction
that bullets fire in.

Bullet Pattern nodes will either create new, unique patterns themselves, or
modify the patterns in their children.

The leaf nodes of each pattern should be a SpawnOne.

## Fan

Convert each bullet in the child pattern into a fan.

| Variables      |                                                             |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| angle          | The angle of the fan in degrees.                            |
| count          | The number of bullets to spawn.                             |
| delayPerBullet | The amount of time, in seconds, between bullets in the fan. |

## Interleaved Fan

Converts each bullet in the child into pairs of Interleaved fans.

Generally this component should only be used with a few children.

| Variables     |                                                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| repeatCount   | The number of pairs of fans to spawn.             |
| outerAngle    | The angle of the larger of the fan pairs.         |
| count         | The number of bullets to spawn in the larger fan. |
| delayPerVolly | The delay for each bullet in the volly.           |
| withLastFan   | Include an extra outer fan at the end.            |

## Repeat

Repeats the child pattern multiple times.

| Variables      |                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ |
| repeatCount    | The number of times to repeat. |
| delayPerRepeat | The delay per each repeat.     |

## Sequence

Spawn each child in sequence, one after the other.

| Variables |                                        |
| --------- | -------------------------------------- |
| delay     | The delay between each child sequence. |

## Spawn One

Returns a single bullet spawn.

| Variables |                                                                           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| position  | The position, relative to the host, to spawn the bullet at.               |
| delay     | The delay, in seconds, before this bullet fires.                          |
| speed     | The speed of the bullet.                                                  |
| angle     | The unit angle, in degrees, to spawn the bullet at. 0 is right. 90 is up. |
| lifetime  | How long the bullet should live for.                                      |
| prefab    | The bullet prefab to spawn. Must be defined for this to work.             |
