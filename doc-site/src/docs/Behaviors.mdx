# Behaviors

Behaviors are child nodes that you can place under a behavior host to modify the
behavior of the host.

The host will run each child behavior attached to it in the order that they're
attached.

Behaviors can broadcast and recieve events from other behaviors.

## AnimatedBehavior

The animated behavior will look for timelines attached to it and run those
timelines `start` animation.

## BulletPatterns

When this behavior recieves a fire event it will find a bullet pattern attached
to this behavior and fire it.

## FireOnEvent

When an event of the specified type is recieved this behavior will broadcast a
fire event to the other behaviors.
