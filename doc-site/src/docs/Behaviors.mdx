# Actors

Actors are nodes that can be modified by attaching behaviors to them.

# Behaviors

Behaviors are child nodes that you can place under a actor to modify the
behavior of the actor.

The actor will run each child behavior attached to it in the order that they're
attached.

Behaviors can broadcast and recieve events from other behaviors.

## AnimatedBehavior

The animated behavior will look for timelines attached to it and run those
timelines `start` animation.

## BulletPatterns

When this behavior recieves a fire event it will find a bullet pattern attached
to this behavior and fire it.

fire event to the other behaviors.
