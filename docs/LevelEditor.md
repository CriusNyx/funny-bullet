# Level Editor

The level system allows developers to create levels using a drag and drop node based system. Levels 
are composed of Level Events that control the behavior of the level. Events can have children, and 
will run until they've completed their task, and all of their children have completed their tasks.

For more information on levels events see [Level Events](./LevelEvents.md)
